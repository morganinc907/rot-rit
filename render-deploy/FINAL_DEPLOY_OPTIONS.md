# ðŸš€ FINAL DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS

## Railway Deployment Methods

### Method 1: GitHub Connect (Easiest)
Since Railway doesn't show direct upload, they prefer GitHub:

1. **Push your API to GitHub** (we already have the repo)
2. **Connect Railway to GitHub repo**
3. **Set root directory to `/api`**

### Method 2: Railway CLI (If Available)
```bash
# Only if Railway CLI is installed
railway login
railway link -p 6ab382ba-cfe8-4199-985d-b95aa30c0e92
railway up
```

### Method 3: Alternative Platforms

#### Option A: Render.com (Super Simple)
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. "New Web Service"
3. Connect GitHub or upload zip
4. Deploy!

#### Option B: Netlify Functions
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) 
2. Drag the `api` folder
3. Auto-deploys serverless functions

#### Option C: Railway via GitHub
Since you already have GitHub repo at https://github.com/morganinc907/rot-rit.git:

1. **Go to Railway project**
2. **Click "Connect GitHub"** 
3. **Select your `rot-rit` repository**
4. **Set Root Directory: `api`**
5. **Deploy!**

## ðŸŽ¯ FASTEST PATH

**Use GitHub + Railway:**

## âš¡ ALTERNATIVE: Quick Test

For immediate testing, you could temporarily:
1. Use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to expose localhost
2. Update contract with ngrok URL
3. Test NFTs show cosmetics
4. Then deploy properly to Railway
