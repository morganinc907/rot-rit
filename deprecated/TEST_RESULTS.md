#### Test Results:
1. **"deploys and wires contracts with correct constructors"**
   - ✅ Deploys all 5 core contracts with proper constructor parameters
   - ✅ Configures all contract permissions and references  
   - ✅ Tests key sacrifice functionality (10 keys → 7 keys after sacrifice)
   - ✅ Validates contract integration end-to-end

2. **"tests contract integration without VRF"**
   - ✅ Validates Relics minting functionality
   - ✅ Tests CosmeticsV2 type creation
   - ✅ Confirms contract interactions work correctly

### ✅ **Deployed Contracts Validation** - `test/deployed-contracts.test.js`
- **Status**: 1/1 tests passing (2 skipped for network connectivity)
- **Duration**: ~115ms
- **Coverage**: Live contract address validation

#### Test Results:
1. **"should have correct deployed contract addresses documented"**
   - ✅ All 9 contract addresses are valid Ethereum addresses
   - ✅ All addresses are unique (no duplicates)
   - ✅ Complete ecosystem properly documented
